# EffectBerriesMod
In this I have made 33 kinds of berries, each one corresponding to an effect in vanilla Minecraft. 
The bushes apply a short period of each effect, the berries last longer, and there are new pies for each berry, which lasts even longer. 
4 seconds, 15 seconds, and 1.5 minutes respectively.

There is also a new villager that will trade all the berries to you. You must craft the workstation as it will not be in any villages naturally.
